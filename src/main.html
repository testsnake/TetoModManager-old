    <p>Welcome to Teto Mod Manager</p>
    <p>This is an early alpha build and as a result many things may not work as intended.</p>
    <p>The final build of TMM will also look a lot nicer, as well as a better layout. Currently, I'm focusing on getting this mod manager working.</p>
    <p>For now, you can use this mod manager to manage installed mods, but you will need to manually install the mods.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to <a href="https://discord.com/users/201460040564080651">message me on discord.</a></p>
    <p>You can also join the <a href="https://discord.gg/megamixplus">Mega Mix+ Modding Server</a> to get help from other modders.</p>
    <p>Thanks for using Teto Mod Manager!</p>
